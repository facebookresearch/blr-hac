## Requirements  
BLR-HAC is tested on   
* Ubuntu 22  
  
## Installing BLR-HAC
`conda create -n blrhac python=3.8 mpi4py=3.1`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
install pytorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/  

## Running BLR-HAC  
**Create a dataset**  
`python sample_objectives.py`  
`python sample_sequences.py`  

**Train a model**  
`python trainers.py`  

**Evaluate the model on zero-shot:**  
`python evaluators.py eval_fn=eval_prefs`  

**Evaluate the model on stationary adaptation:**  
For linear and mlp:  
`python evaluators.py eval_fn=eval_online`  

For transformer baseline:  
`python evaluators.py eval_fn=eval_online_sgd`  

**Evaluate the model on nonstationary adaptation:**  
For linear and mlp:  
`python evaluators.py eval_fn=eval_online_switching`  

For transformer baseline:  
`python evaluators.py eval_fn=eval_switching_sgd`
